Whatever is, is right
From Alexander Pope's poem, An Essay on Man, Epistle I:

Cease then, nor ORDER Imperfection name:
Our proper bliss depends on what we blame.
Know they own point: This kind, this due degree
Of blindness, weakness, Heav'n bestows on thee.
Submit -- In this, or any other sphere,
Secure to be as blest as thou canst bear:
Safe in the hand of one disposing Pow'r,
Or in the natal, or hte mortal hour.
All Nature is but Art, unknown to thee;
All Chance, Direction, which thou canst not see;
All Discord, Harmony, not understood;
All partial Evil, universal Good:
And, spite of Pride, in erring Reason's spite,
One truth is clear, "Whatever IS, is RIGHT."

-- 281-94.

Pope refers to the condition of all people, not men or women particularly. The last line came, over the course of the eighteenth century, to represent a docile acquiescence to problems. Samuel Johnson likens his facile optimism to Leibniz.
